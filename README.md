# React Playbook


*A visual learning tool to explore React internals ‚Äî JSX compilation, Virtual DOM, Diffing, and Reconciliation.*

## \:beginner: About

React Playbook is an interactive React app designed to help developers and learners visualize and understand React‚Äôs core concepts under the hood. The app includes demos for JSX compilation, Virtual DOM structure, diffing algorithms, and reconciliation flows ‚Äî making complex React internals easy to grasp.

## üöÄ **Features**

### 1. JSX Compilation Demo  
* Live conversion of JSX code to React.createElement calls to demonstrate JSX transformation.

### 2. Virtual DOM Visualization  
* Displays the Virtual DOM tree structure to explain React‚Äôs rendering process.

### 3. Diffing Algorithm Demo  
* Visualizes how React compares Virtual DOM trees to detect changes.

### 4. Reconciliation Flow  
* Shows step-by-step UI updates React performs to sync with changes efficiently.
